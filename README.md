# S3Simulator-A-benchmarking-Side-Scan-Sonar-simulator-dataset-for-Underwater-Image-Analysis

Acoustic sonar imaging systems are widely used for under-
water surveillance in both civilian and military sectors. However, the
acquisition of high-quality sonar datasets for training Artificial Intelli-
gence (AI) models confronts challenges such as limited data availability,
financial constraints and data confidentiality. To overcome these chal-
lenges, we propose a novel benchmark dataset of Simulated Side-Scan
Sonar images, which we term as ‘S3Simulator dataset’. Our dataset
creation utilizes advanced simulation techniques to accurately replicate
underwater conditions and produce diverse synthetic sonar imaging. In
particular, the cutting-edge AI segmentation tool i.e. Segment Anything
Model (SAM) is leveraged for optimally isolating and segmenting the ob-
ject images, such as ships and planes, from real scenes. Further, advanced
Computer-Aided Design tools i.e. SelfCAD, and simulation software such
as Gazebo are employed to create the 3D model and to optimally visualize
within realistic environments, respectively. Further, a range of compu-
tational imaging techniques are employed to improve the quality of the
data, enabling the AI models for the analysis of the sonar images. Exten-
sive analyses are carried out on S3simulator as well as real sonar datasets
to validate the performance of AI models for underwater object classifi-
cation. Our experimental results highlight that the S3Simulator dataset
will be a promising benchmark dataset for research on underwater image
analysis.
